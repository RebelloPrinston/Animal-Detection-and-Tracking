# Animal-Detection-and-Tracking
This project focuses on detection of wild animals and counting the no. of appearances using tensorflow model. It uses the Google Tensorflow API that is available in their github repository.The link given below gives you the API:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection

This API is specially used for Object Detection and the API is dependent on the tool labelImg.py file which is the tool for labeling the object in the image to be detected.

We can train our model and use them for various other purpose by placing as many data sets as possible in the train and test folders
The steps will be given in Steps.md file.
